      <description>In another post, Jason vs. Page Weight – Accessibility Series, pt. 2, I talked about a solving page weight problem I had with a client. In the end, the client decided to put a lot of data on a single page. In my opinion, this would have been a great time to use AJAX to pull in the data rather than just pushing it all to the page at load. The problem with AJAX is that it relies on JavaScript (reliance may, in fact, be too weak a term, honestly) and so would not have been ideal for search engines and would not have provided accessible page content.</description>

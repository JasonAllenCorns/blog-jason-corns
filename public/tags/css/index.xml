      <description>&lt;p&gt;A short while ago, the Boston Globe rolled out a redesigned website. To say that it was just redesigned is an understatement, though – the new entity is the result of Responsive Web Design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, why jealousy?  I have not yet had the opportunity to work on a responsive redesign yet; REALLY jealous of all parties involved!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Semantic Css Establishing a Visual Outline</title>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s move beyond simply linting our code, and delve into creating a visual outline of our CSS. Anyone who writes code, anything from simple UI shifts through complex exotic joins, inherits a responsibility to write reasonable code. Good code solves a problem or answers a question; well-written code lives on, open and accessible to future developers.
Before we begin, let me say that the delivered stylesheet should be minified and free of excess spaces, tabs, semicolons and lengths of 0px instead of “0″, using tools like the YUI compressor or the CSS Drive Online CSS Compression Utility.</description>

Like its signature, pervasive mantle of moss, the Pacific Northwest continues to grow on me since I switched coasts in 2011. I find outlet in abundance, codification of all my eclectic interests.  With the singular caveat of "_as long as you don't mind getting wet_", my family and I are now thriving in a community abundant in outdoor adventure, clever vacationers, staunch local-eers, and a comfortingly consistent group of ferry (cyclist) commuters.

I enjoy year-round golf with a few foolish friends, and am thrilled by the dynamic backdrops for family-friendly hikes. As a burgeoning PNW Adventurer, I find exactly what I need, in being adventurously close to Snoqualmie Ridge, the Olympic Mountain Range, Port Townsend, and the Pacific Coast.  As a life-long mathematician and software engineer, I have stumbled into a mecca for like-minded individuals who are as passionate about their diverse interests as they about the diversity of their interests - and I love every moment of it.
